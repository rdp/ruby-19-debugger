**Note:** Because google-code no longer supports file downloads -- crucial to this project -- this project has been moved to https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruby-debugger-runtime/


A patched version of MRI Ruby 2.1.5, or 1.9.3 which provides additional run-time introspection and support for the trepanning debugger. Although the trepanning debugger is targeted, the changes faciliate other debuggers, tracers or code coverage or code inspection packages.

In addition to the patched code as a tar ball, OS specific packages in additional formats are also provided.
