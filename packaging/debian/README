Until I can better figure out how to organize things, this directory
is not usable as is for building a deb. 

So here is what you gotta do.

0. Create a directory called ruby19d

1. cd ruby19d

2. Download the source:
   wget http://ruby-19-debugger.googlecode.com/files/ruby-1.9.3-p374-debugger.tar.gz

3. Rename it:
   mv ruby-1.9.3-p374-debugger.tar.gz ruby19d_374.orig.tar.gz

4. Unpack it:
   tar -xf ruby19d_374.orig.tar.gz

5. cd ruby-1.9.3-p374

6. copy the contents of this directory into ruby-1.9.3-p374
   cp -r ???/ruby-19-debugger/packaging/debian  .

7. Make whatever changes you want to the packaging here.
  
....

n-2. Oh yeah -- build the Debian package: 

   debuild -us -uc

n-1. Install that package:
   sudo dpkg -i <ruby19.deb>

n. Add the trepanning debugger with optional code for colorization

   sudo gem install trepanning coderay term-ansicolor
