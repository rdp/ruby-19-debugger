Here is how to build the RPM from stratch.

0. Make sure you can run rpmbuild. This is in the rpmbuild package.
   yum install rpm-build

1. Get dependent libraries. Again with possibly yum: 
   bison 
   gcc 
   gdbm 
   gdbm-devel 
   glibc-devel 
   libffi-devel
   libyaml-devel
   make 
   ncurses 
   ncurses-devel 
   openssl-devel 
   readline 
   readline-devel 
   ruby
   unzip 

2. Get the debugger source: 

    wget http://ruby-19-debugger.googlecode.com/files/ruby-1.9.3-p374-debugger.tar.gz

3. Copy it to where rpmbuild wants it. 
   The simplest way I've found to figure that out is to run :

   rpmbuild -ba ruby19d.spec

4. Run the rpmbuild

   rpmbuild -ba ruby19d.spec

   At the end the you'll be told where the RPMs are located. 

5. Install that rpm build in 4.

   rpm -ivh <rpm-file-built-in-step-4>
